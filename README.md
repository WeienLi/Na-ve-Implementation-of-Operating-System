# Na-ve-Implementation-of-Operating-System
This an naive implementation of Operating System. It implements a simple shell language using C languages with some basic functions and pipelining. It also implements a thread scheduler where we have a thread pool and treat each thread like a core of CPU. Last we also implements a simple File system using C languages where we can do some basic operations to a file within the filesystem.
